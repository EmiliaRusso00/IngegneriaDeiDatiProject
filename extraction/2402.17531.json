            "To validate the advantages of Nissist, we analyze a subset of incidents consist of inner- and cross-TSGs types. An inner-TSG incident refers to the mitigation knowledge being contained within an individual TSG, whereas a cross-TSG incident requires involvement from multiple TSGs, which may belong to different service teams. Table               1             illustrates that Nissist significantly reduces TTM compared to relying solely on human intervention and unstructured TSGs.Specifically, for incidents of varying mitigation steps, those with inner-TSGs demonstrate a reduction in TTM ranging from 85% to 98%, shorter steps in mitigation process have a more pronounced effect on TTM reduction.Conversely, for incidents that cross-TSGs, the TTM is typically longer, with the help of Nissist, we are able to reduce the TTM by 84.7%. Note that we hide the absolute TTM values for confidentiality reasons."
