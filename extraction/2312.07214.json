            "A common complaint lodged by the participants was that the system took too long to answer. In the application, there was a visual cue to indicate the status of the transcription and which robots were currently processing it to let the users know that they had been heard. However, there was an amount of delay before the robots’ responses that was unlike an inter-human conversation, where feedback is usually instant.This led to cases in which participants started talking without waiting for the responses, as described by P9:             “In terms of naturalness, the robots’ feedback always came late. There was a lot of narration, and by the time they responded, I had already continued speaking”            .This is reflected by the             “Speed”            dimension of the                     SASSI                   , where the system received an average score of 5.25 (M = 5.25, SD = 1.57) (see Table                     1                   ), with 7 being the slowest.The reason for this behavior are due to the technical setup and we will discuss them in more detail in the discussion section.",
