            "Rather than relying solely on conventional datasets typically utilized in research, we opted to assess the efficacy of our framework using the GSM8K dataset, chosen to specifically demonstrate the capabilities of our approach. We employed four distinct types of agents in our experimentation: a single LLM agent powered by the GPT3.5-turbo model, two LLM agents supported by GPT3.5-turbo models, two LLM agents utilizing the GPT3.5-turbo model combined with the chain-of-thought and persona approach         [           Wei etÂ al., 2022b          ]             [           Rasal, 2024          ]        , and finally, two LLM agents operating with the GPT4 model         [           OpenAI, 2023          ]        for orchestration and decomposition methodology and GPT3.5-turbo model for the specialized LLM agents, which involves breaking down the primary problem into subproblems. Our orchestration framework represents a notable advancement over existing methodologies, with detailed results presented in Table               1             ."
