            "Based on the user study, it is clear that users majorly prefer either MVDream or         YouDream        . Hence we also compute CLIP similarity score for each of the two methods as the average CLIP score over 9 views of each of the 22 prompts used for the user study. Table               1             shows that our method outperforms MVDream based on the CLIP similarity score. We use the ViT-B/32 model for evaluation."
