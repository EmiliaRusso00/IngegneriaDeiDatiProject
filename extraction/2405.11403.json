In contrast, we combine all these paradigms and bridge their gaps (See Table               1             ). Among others, in different contexts of generic problem-solving, Tree-of-thoughts         Yao et¬†al. (           2023          )        , and Cumulative reasoning         Zhang et¬†al. (           2023          )        approaches consider a tree traversal approach to explore different sub-steps towards a solution while our code generation approach mirrors the human programming cycle through various LLM agents. Notably, our traversal does not rely on sub-steps toward the solution but instead utilizes different forms of complete solutions."

Similarly, with ChatGPT, there‚Äôs a notable 26.3% drop in performance where in several cases their AI generated test cases are incorrect. We observe that 8% of failures in HumanEval and 15% in MBPP is caused by their AI generates incorrect test cases while our approach is independent of AI test cases, and consistently improves code generations in general. Consequently, even in HumanEval, with GPT-4, our Pass@1 surpasses Reflexion by                          ‚àº                               similar-to                              \\sim                       3%.
